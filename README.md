Using Treebank dataset of NLTK with the 'universal' tagset comprising 12 coarse tag classes modify the Viterbi and Hidden Markov Model algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. Using any of the approaches example lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc solve the problem of unknown words.  Compare the tagging accuracy after modifying vanilla Viterbi and list down at least 3 cases from sample test where original Viterbi POS tagger incorrectly tagged words and got corrected after modifications.
